    <p style="font-size:24px;">Greetings Flanagan Info Hub Staff,</p><br>
      <img src="img/witlogo.png" id="logo"/>
      <p>Meet your new buddy!  HubBuddy aims to ease jobs at the Flanagan Campus Center Info Hub.
        HubBuddy will allow staff members to track room counts and track loaner deployment records.
        The recorded information logs can also be sent to the main office all at once by accessing Firebase.  </p><br>
      <p>The <b>Deployment</b> button below is for deploying loaner equipment.<br>
        The <b>Room Count</b> button below is for performing room counts.<br>
        The <b>Records</b> button below is for accessing the database.</p>
