          ACCESS DATABASE
      </a><br>
      <p>When accessing the Firebase database, you can have full control of adding/deleting/editing items,
        making it very dangerous.  For security and protection purposes, you must first acquire permission
        to access the database, so that may be a reason why you might not be able to access the linked button.</p>
      <p>To retrieve data from this database, click on the more options icon (with three dots) at the
        right corner to EXPORT JSON data.  The room count database logs will be downloaded to your computer.</p>
